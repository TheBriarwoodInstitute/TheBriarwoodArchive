        <h1>Case File: The Merchant</h1>

        <p><strong>Agent:</strong> Freya Sinclair</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/09/1835 (First opened), 14/10/2053 (Reopened)</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> The Merchant and the Sealed Gauntlet</p>

        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>The Briarwood Institute, established during the 1800s in Britain, was initially formed to combat occult and supernatural phenomena. Over the years, the Institute shifted its focus towards handling extreme crimes and abnormal occurrences. Among the artifacts obtained by the Institute was a mysterious metal gauntlet, acquired from a peculiar individual referred to as "The Merchant." The gauntlet's properties and the true nature of the transaction, known as "The Price," remain undisclosed. This case file aims to collate all available information on The Merchant and the enigmatic gauntlet.</p>

        <h2>Incident Summary:</h2>
        <p>In the early days of The Briarwood Institute, Alden Briarwood and his team encountered The Merchant, a man exuding an eerie and unsettling aura. The Merchant, despite appearing ordinary, offered the Institute a metal gauntlet, the details of which were never specified. Similarly, the true nature of "The Price" demanded in exchange for the gauntlet remains shrouded in mystery.</p>

        <h2>The Gauntlet:</h2>
        <p>The sealed metal gauntlet remains securely locked in an old Briarwood safe within the Institute's base. No Institute documentation offers any insights into its potential capabilities or intended purpose. The gauntlet's properties and its possible effects on the world are unknown, leaving the Institute members deeply unsettled.</p>

        <h2>The Disappearance of The Merchant:</h2>
        <p>Following the transaction, The Merchant vanished without a trace. Only a single photograph was sent to the Institute in a letter, accompanied by a cryptic message: "Why do you not use the gauntlet when it can give so much?" Despite attempts to locate The Merchant, no further contact was established.</p>

        <h2>Subsequent Appearances:</h2>
        <p>Decades after the initial encounter, a member of the Briarwood Team from the 1910s reported spotting The Merchant observing them from a distance. The Merchant waved and then silently disappeared into the night. However, no further appearances have been recorded since then.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing Concern:</h2>
        <p>The potential return of The Merchant continues to haunt the Institute. Despite years of silence, the fear of encountering The Merchant again persists among the team members.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>The enigmatic Merchant's identity and motivations remain unresolved. The sealed gauntlet, with its undisclosed properties and associated "Price," poses a significant mystery for The Briarwood Institute. The potential implications of the gauntlet, coupled with The Merchant's cryptic messages and sporadic appearances, have left the team on edge. Until further information surfaces, the sealed gauntlet and The Merchant will continue to remain subjects of intrigue and concern for The Briarwood Institute.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Additional information or updates on this case may require further investigation and monitoring of the situation. All Institute personnel are advised to exercise caution if The Merchant or related incidents resurface. This case remains open for further research and documentation.</p>
