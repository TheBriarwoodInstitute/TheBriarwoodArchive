            [IANTO CADIGAN'S PSYCH EVALUATION - 2052]<br><br>
            Patient Name: Ianto Cadigan<br>
            Date of Evaluation: 08/02/2052<br><br>
            Presenting Issue:<br>
            I am conducting a psychological evaluation on Mr. Ianto Cadigan, who recently experienced the loss of his father. As his doctor, I am not aware of the specific details of his occupation, but I understand that he worked as a police captain. My primary focus is to assess his emotional well-being and coping mechanisms following the loss of his father.<br><br>
            Patient History:<br>
            Mr. Ianto Cadigan is a 28-year-old man with no significant medical history, apart from reporting occasional stress-related headaches. He is employed as a police captain and has been in this position for the past six years. He has not been previously diagnosed with any mental health conditions.<br><br>
            Reason for Referral:<br>
            Mr. Cadigan was referred for a psych evaluation following the recent loss of his father, whom he was reportedly close to. The circumstances surrounding his father's death were somewhat unusual and may have impacted his emotional state.<br><br>
            Current Mental State:<br>
            During the initial session, Mr. Cadigan presented as a reserved and composed individual, though he appeared somewhat guarded. He showed no signs of acute distress, but it was evident that he was dealing with significant grief.<br><br>
            Grief and Loss:<br>
            Mr. Cadigan shared that his father, whom he deeply admired, recently passed away. While he did not provide explicit details regarding the cause of death, he expressed that the series of events leading to his father's passing were unconventional. He described feeling shocked and devastated by the loss, struggling to come to terms with the absence of his father's presence in his life.<br><br>
            Emotional Expression and Coping Mechanisms:<br>
            In the session, Mr. Cadigan demonstrated restrained emotional expression. He acknowledged that he tends to keep his feelings to himself, especially in a professional setting. It is possible that this emotional restraint is a result of his role as a police captain, where maintaining composure is often expected.<br><br>
            Regarding coping mechanisms, Mr. Cadigan reported that he tries to process his emotions privately, primarily through writing in a journal. He acknowledged that he is not yet fully comfortable discussing his feelings with others and tends to rely on self-reflection as a means of managing his grief.<br>
