            Freya Sinclair first encountered The Briarwood Institute when she accidentally witnessed the institute combatting an unknown creature. She was knocked out and taken to the institute's base, where she was handcuffed with her arms bound behind the chair. She was given a pill intended to wipe the last 24 hours of her memory, though she tucked it underneath her tongue to make it seem like she had taken it. After this, she managed to escape from her handcuffs and attempted to run. Ianto Cadigan was impressed by Freya's skill and ingenuity, deciding to offer her a job instead of trying to wipe her memory again or killing her.
