            [EXTRACT FROM THE MESSAGES OF IANTO CADIGAN AND LIAM O'CONNOR  - MARCH 2ND 2054]<br><br>
            LIAM: Hey, captain. I looked into that supposed genuine alien artefact that fella was selling on Ebay.<br>
            IANTO: And?<br>
            LIAM: Surprisingly, it was real. I went and got that off of him, then wiped his memory of having it.<br>
            IANTO: When you say "you got that off of him", what do you mean?<br>
            LIAM: I went and beat the shit out of him, then just took it.<br>
            IANTO: Please be joking.<br>
            LIAM: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I am. I just gave him the money he wanted, then slipped him the memory loss pill. Took back the money after he passed out from the pill too.<br>
            IANTO: Good. Put the artefact in the vaults if you haven't already.<br>
            LIAM: Oh. Right. Yeah, ok.<br>
            IANTO: You haven't put it in the vaults yet, have you?<br>
            LIAM: Nope. Sorry. I've just had it sitting on my desk.<br>
            IANTO: Just put it in the vaults, ok?<br>
