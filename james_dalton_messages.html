            [EXTRACT FROM THE MESSAGES OF IANTO CADIGAN AND JAMES DALTON - JANUARY 18TH 2054]<br><br>
            IANTO: Hey. You at your computer?<br>
            JAMES: Yup, what's up?<br>
            IANTO: I was just wondering if you had finished that report yet?<br>
            JAMES: Nearly done. I'll put it on your desk later. Cool?<br>
            IANTO: Yeah. That's fine. Thanks.<br>
            JAMES: Also, any other leads on that business with the Gnawback fighting ring?<br>
            IANTO: We've had a few, though there isn't any hints towards the location.<br>
            JAMES: That's a shame, I've been hoping to take them out soon.<br>
            IANTO: I know, you keep talking about it.<br>
            JAMES: I don't talk about it that much.<br>
            JAMES: Do I?<br>
            IANTO: Yeah, you do.<br>
            JAMES: Damn.<br>
