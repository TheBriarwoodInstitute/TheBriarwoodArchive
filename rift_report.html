        <p class="report-text">Prepared by: Liam O'Connor, Technologist and Security Advisor, Briarwood Institute</p>
        <p class="report-text">Date: 25/07/53</p>

        <h2 class="report-text">Introduction:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the enigmatic temporal anomaly known as the "Rift in Time" that stretches across the British Isles. The Briarwood Institute acknowledges the unpredictable nature of this phenomenon and seeks to shed light on its origins and the external force believed to address temporal anomalies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="report-text">Description of the Rift:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            The Rift in Time appears as a spatial distortion that spans from the tip of Scotland to the bottom of England, with ancillary energy tendrils extending towards Ireland. Randomly and without warning, the Rift seizes individuals and objects, propelling them to disparate points in time. Curiously, these occurrences often lead to the present day, though the reasoning behind this remains elusive.
        </p>

        <h2 class="report-text">Temporal Anomalies and Paradoxes:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            Instances of temporal anomalies and paradoxes are rampant within the vicinity of the Rift. The Briarwood Institute has documented various reports of unexplained disappearances, sudden appearances of historical objects, and unanticipated encounters with figures from the past. Despite people and objects coming through, calculations have been made that have made it clear that we are unable to harness or enter the Rift ourselves.
        </p>

        <h2 class="report-text">External Intervention:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            The Briarwood Institute posits the existence of an external force responsible for rectifying temporal anomalies. However, it remains a perplexing enigma why this force has not intervened to seal the Rift in Time. Further investigations are required to unravel the intricacies of this phenomenon and the motives behind the absence of intervention.
        </p>

        <h2 class="report-text">Notable Findings:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            Notable people and objects that we have found that have been taken by the Rift include a Roman soldier, the fresh carcass of a mammoth, a cybernetic hand we suspect to be from the future, a Dodo, and a piece of Kryzon.
        </p>

        <h2 class="report-text">Recommendations:</h2>
        <ul class="report-text">
            <li>Conduct further research on the origins and characteristics of the Rift in Time.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with the Greater Scottish government to ensure a coordinated approach.</li>
            <li>Establish communication channels with the external force responsible for fixing temporal anomalies to gain insights into their motivations, though this one is unlikely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="report-text">Conclusion:</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            The Rift in Time remains an ongoing mystery that demands extensive study and attention. The Briarwood Institute is committed to unraveling its secrets and ensuring the safety of the British Isles and its inhabitants. As we continue our efforts, it is crucial to maintain vigilance and adapt to the dynamic challenges posed by this temporal anomaly.
