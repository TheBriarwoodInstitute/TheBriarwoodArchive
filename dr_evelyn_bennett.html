            Evelyn Bennett first encountered The Briarwood Institute when she was sent to assist injured people after a large explosion took place. She met James Dalton first when she tended to his wounded leg, as he had been caught in the explosion as the institute had been there investigating strange energy surges. Despite the fact that Evelyn saw the machine that was releasing the energy surges, James decided not to have her memory of the experience wiped as he believed her medical skills to be very useful to the institute as they did not currently have a medical professional hired.
