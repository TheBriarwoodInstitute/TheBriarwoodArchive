        <h1>Case File: The Time God</h1>

        <p><strong>Agent:</strong> Ianto Cadigan</p>
        <p><strong>Case Opened:</strong> 08/03/53</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> The Enigma Entity - A Time God?</p>

        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The Briarwood Institute has encountered a mysterious entity known as "Enigma," a man who defies conventional understanding of time and existence. Enigma is recorded as an employee of Enigma Enhancements, having worked there for six years, but investigations reveal that he doesn't exist as a regular human being. Instead, he appears to be an enigmatic being with the ability to transcend time itself. As the team captain and analyst of the Institute, I have delved into the enigma surrounding this entity and compiled my findings below.</p>

        <h2>Enigma's History:</h2>
        <p>Enigma Enhancements' employee records indicate a six-year tenure for a person named "Enigma," but upon closer inspection, no one within the company seems to recall his presence. The name "Enigma" itself raises eyebrows, and it becomes evident that this person's existence is shrouded in mystery.</p>

        <h2>Visual Records:</h2>
        <p>A single photograph of Enigma exists in the files of Enigma Enhancements. He appears as an average-looking man in his late twenties to early thirties, sporting short brown hair. However, his attire is anything but ordinary, as he wears a distinctive ensemble consisting of a black suit of armor with a purple crystal embedded in the abdomen, topped with a long brown trench coat.</p>

        <h2>Temporal Anomalies:</h2>
        <p>The plot thickens as pictures are discovered, placing Enigma at various historical events, including the assassination of JFK, standing behind Hitler at one of his rallies, and even on Omaha Beach during the war. His presence in these events, while unnoticed by others, raises serious questions about his true nature.</p>

        <h2>Time God Encounter:</h2>
        <p>The Briarwood Institute's past encounters with Enigma have been peculiar, to say the least. A previous team stumbled upon an artifact believed to enable time travel. Upon its testing, time froze, and Enigma, the Time God, manifested before them. He reprimanded the team, destroyed the artifact, unfroze time, and then disappeared. This encounter hints at Enigma's apparent control over temporal anomalies.</p>

        <h2>Goblin Delivery:</h2>
        <p>Another historical account reveals an incident in the early 1900s, where Enigma visited the Briarwood base, uninvited and unannounced, and left behind a small goblin-like creature. He later returned to retrieve the creature, adding yet another layer of inexplicability to his actions.</p>

        <h2>Personal Reflection:</h2>
        <p>Encountering an entity with such profound control over time and its own existence is both thrilling and disconcerting. As team captain, I take my responsibility seriously, and unraveling the enigma of Enigma becomes a priority. The notion of a "Time God" sounds like something straight out of mythology, but our encounters with him make it difficult to dismiss this possibility.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>The existence of Enigma, an enigmatic entity defying conventional understanding of time and space, challenges the very fabric of reality. His appearances in historical events and his apparent control over temporal anomalies make him a unique and powerful being. As I continue to log our team's encounters and delve deeper into Enigma's mysteries, I remain cautiously intrigued by the potential implications of his existence.</p>

        <p>As we continue our pursuit of the truth, one thing is certain: the enigma of Enigma is far from being resolved. And until we uncover the truth behind his mysterious nature, the Briarwood Institute will remain vigilant in its quest to comprehend the inexplicable.</p>
