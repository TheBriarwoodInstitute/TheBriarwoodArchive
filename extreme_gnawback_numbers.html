        <h1>Case File: Extreme Gnawback Numbers</h1>

        <p><strong>Agent:</strong> Ianto Cadigan</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 31/10/52</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Gnawbacks</p>

        <h2>Incident Overview:</h2>
        <p>Gnawbacks, violent carnivorous beasts of unknown origin, have been increasingly appearing for over a century. The number of encounters has risen dramatically, with a significant concentration around Cardiff, Wales. The cause of the heightened frequency remains elusive.</p>

        <h2>Nature of the Threat:</h2>
        <p>Gnawbacks are aggressive, carnivorous creatures that attack without warning, posing a severe risk to public safety. Their violent behavior has resulted in numerous fatalities and requires immediate attention.</p>

        <h2>Current Hypotheses:</h2>
        <p><strong>Rift in Time Connection:</strong> The higher frequency of Gnawback appearances near Cardiff may be linked to the Rift in Time present over Britain. However, the precise mechanism behind their increased concentration remains unknown.</p>
        <p><strong>Unpredictable Origin:</strong> Due to the nature of the Rift, determining the true origin or timeline of the Gnawbacks is challenging. The ability to enter or send anything into the Rift further complicates efforts to identify their source.</p>

        <h2>Objectives:</h2>
        <p>The primary objective is to reduce the number of Gnawbacks being brought through the Rift to minimize the threat to public safety and prevent further loss of innocent lives. Understanding the reason for their higher frequency around Cardiff will aid in devising effective containment strategies.</p>

        <h2>Actions Taken:</h2>
        <p><strong>Enhanced Surveillance:</strong> Increased monitoring around the Rift in Time to gather more data on Gnawback appearances and any patterns associated with their arrival.</p>
        <p><strong>Containment and Neutralization:</strong> Developing and implementing effective methods to contain and neutralize the Gnawbacks to prevent them from causing harm to civilians.</p>
